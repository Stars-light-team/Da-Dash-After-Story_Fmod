2. **Clone this repository:**
   - Click the green **"Code"** button above
   - Select **"Open with GitHub Desktop"**
   - Choose your desired local folder (e.g., `Documents/Projects/DDAS-FMOD`)

## üéº Audio Development Workflow

### Opening the Project
1. Launch **FMOD Studio**
2. Open the main project file: `Da-Dash-After-Story_Fmod.fspro`
3. You'll see the complete audio architecture for the game

### Making Changes
- **Add new audio assets** (music tracks, sound effects, voice lines)
- **Create and modify events** for dynamic audio implementation
- **Adjust parameters** for adaptive music and interactive sound design
- **Set up audio routing** and effects processing

### Building for Integration
1. After making changes, **build the banks:**
   - Go to **File ‚Üí Build** in the top menu
   - This generates the `.bank` files that Unity will use
2. **Always build before committing** to ensure integration files are up to date

## üîÑ Version Control Best Practices

### Submitting Your Changes
1. **Open GitHub Desktop**
2. **Review your changes** in the left panel
3. **Write a descriptive commit message** (examples):
   - `Add new dash sound effect with random pitch variation`
   - `Update boss battle music with dynamic layers`
   - `Fix reverb settings for cave environments`
4. **Click "Commit to main"** then **"Push origin"**

### Staying Up to Date
1. **Before starting work:** Open GitHub Desktop and click **"Fetch origin"** ‚Üí **"Pull origin"**
2. **This ensures you have the latest changes** from other team members
3. **Resolve any conflicts** if they arise (rare with FMOD projects)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Guidelines

### Files You Should NOT Modify
- **`Build/` folder** - Contains generated bank files
- **`.cache/` folder** - FMOD's temporary files
- **`.fspro` filename** - Don't rename the main project file
- **Metadata files** - Let FMOD manage these automatically

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Always pull first** - Get the latest version before starting
2. **Work in focused sessions** - Complete related changes together
3. **Test your audio** - Play through events before building
4. **Build banks** - Generate fresh `.bank` files
5. **Commit with clear messages** - Help team members understand changes
6. **Push immediately** - Share your work with the team
